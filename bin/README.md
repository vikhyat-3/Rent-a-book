# Rent-a-book
This is a back-end application which is used to help people rent out books to those living in and around their neighbourhood.


## Dependencies
All dependencies are present in the pom.xml file.
However, I build this using MongoDB locally (not using ATLAS). So make sure you have mongod running on your system.

Update the DB configs in the application.properties file accordingly.
